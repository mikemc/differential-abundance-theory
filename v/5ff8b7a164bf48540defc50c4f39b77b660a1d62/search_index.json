We describe the basic problem posed by taxonomic bias for measuring changes in the abundance of particular taxa across conditions and describe new strategies for mitigating the errors it induces.

References "],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction One of the most basic questions we can ask about microbial communities is: How do different microbial taxa vary in abundance—across space, time, and host or environmental conditions? Advances in sequencing technology allow us to simultaneously measure the abundances of 100s to 1000s of species using marker-gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing (jointly, MGS). Although standard MGS measurements lose information about total microbial density—and so are typically used to analyze the abundances of taxa relative to each other or their total—new studies are increasingly employing strategies to enable the analysis of cell density or other measures of “absolute abundance.” These relative and absolute abundances serve as the basis for a differential-abundance (DA) analysis, in which the change in abundance of a microbial taxon across samples or conditions is used to learn about the biology of the taxon and its impact on the host and other microbes as well as to detect predictive biomarkers of host and environmental health and disease. Although MGS-based DA analysis has been widely deployed and achieved many notable successes, it faces serious concerns over accuracy and reproducibility due to the inherent technical limitations of MGS measurements. In particular, MGS measurements are taxonomically biased: Taxa vary dramatically (e.g. 10-1000X) in how efficiently they are measured—that is, converted from cells into taxonomically classified sequencing reads—by a given MGS protocol (McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019)). As a result, the abundance measurements obtained by MGS are inaccurate representations of the actual abundances and also tend to differ across protocols, studies, and even experimental batches (Yeh et al. (2018),McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019)). This bias arises from variation in how taxa respond to each step in an MGS protocol, from sample collection to bioinformatic classification. Although often associated with variation in primer binding and amplification rates and marker-gene copy-number, large variation in DNA extraction efficiency and in the ability to correctly classify reads make taxonomic bias a feature of both shotgun and marker-gene measurements. The error it causes have been found to in some cases to supersede sizable biological differences (e.g. Lozupone et al. (2013)) and has plausibly caused replication failures for prominent findings such as the association of decreased Bacteroides and increased Firmicutes in stool with obesity (Finucane et al. (2014)) and the association of certain taxa in the vagina of pregnant women with preterm birth (Callahan et al. (2017)). The typical approach to countering taxonomic bias in DA analysis is to standardize the measurement protocol used within a given study. In broad strokes, the thinking is that the measurements of samples measured by the same protocol will be affected by bias in the same way and so the inferred differences between samples (the focus of DA analysis) will be unaffected. For example, if taxonomic bias consistently causes the measured proportion of a given species to be 10X too high, we can still accurately infer its fold changes across samples (Kevorkian et al. (2018),Lloyd et al. (2020)). However, McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019) used theoretical arguments and sequencing measurements of defined bacterial (or ‘mock’) communities to show that consistent taxonomic bias can lead to variable fold errors in measured proportions (Figure 1.1). These varying errors can lead to spurious conclusions for how the proportion of a taxon varies across samples, even in the direction of change (for example, causing a taxon that decreases appear to increase). Yet McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019) also found that the fold error in the ratios among species was constant, making fold changes in ratios robust to bias. The implications of these findings for changes in absolute abundance—which remain subject to taxonomic bias in the underlying MGS measurement—and for DA analysis across many species and many samples—as commonly done in microbiome association testing—have yet to be investigated. Here we use a combination of theoretical analysis, simulation, and re-analysis of published experiments to consider when and why taxonomic bias in MGS measurements leads to spurious results in DA analysis of relative and absolute abundance. Our analysis clarifies how the folk wisdom that taxonomic bias does not affect the analysis of change across samples is only partially correct and can give a false sense of security in the accuracy of DA results. Yet we also present several potential solutions—methods for quantifying, correcting, or otherwise accounting for the effect of taxonomic bias in DA analyses that can be deployed today with only modest changes to existing experimental and analytical workflows. Over time, application of these methods to past and future experiments will provide crucial quantitative information about the conditions under which taxonomic bias creates spurious results for various DA methodologies. Collectively, these methods and insights may provide practical solutions to taxonomic bias in DA analysis and the confidence that is necessary to codify the statistical findings of microbiome studies into readily-translatable scientific knowledge. Figure 1.1: Mock community experiments show that taxonomic bias can distort the measured fold change in an individual species’ proportion across samples. The figure shows the measured vs. actual proportions for a single bacterial species, Lactobacillus crispatus, in a set of bacterial cellular mock communities, and the resulting fold changes between community samples. The inconsistent error in the measured proportions of individual samples (Panel A) leads to inaccurate measurements of fold changes (Panel B). Mock communities were constructed and measured with 16S sequencing by Brooks et al. (2015). The data was re-analyzed by McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019), who showed that despite the inconsistency of the errors in Panel A, taxonomic bias acted consistently across samples.

This model is the simplest model of MGS measurement that includes multiplicative taxonomic bias while respecting the compositional nature of sequencing measurements, in which the total read count for a sample is unrelated to its total cell number or density (Gloor et al. (2017)). We consider a set of microbial species that are measured by a specific MGS protocol. The protocol assigns each sequencing read to at most one sample andsample and species, and we ignore the possibility of contamination or false-positive taxonomic assignments—reads assigned to a given species and sample really do come from that species and sample. Our model stipulates that the assigned read count of species \\(i\\) in sample \\(a\\) equals its cell density multiplied by a species-specific, sample-independent factor and a species-independent, sample-specific factor, \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.1} \\text{reads}_{i}(a) = \\text{density}_{i}(a) \\quad \\cdot \\underbrace{\\text{efficiency}_{i}}_{\\substack{\\text{species specific,} \\\\ \\text{sample independent}}} \\cdot \\quad \\underbrace{\\text{sequencing effort}(a)}_{\\substack{\\text{species independent,} \\\\ \\text{sample specific}}}. \\end{align}\\] The species-specific factor is the relative measurement efficiency (or efficiency for short) of the species, which represents how much more easily that species is measured (converted from cells to assigned reads) relative to an abitrarily chosen reference species (McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019)). The sample-specific factor, which we call the sequencing effort of the sample, reflects the fact that the number of reads per unit cell density varies among samples even in the absence of taxonomic bias due to variation in total density, library normalization, and total sequencing-run output. Equation (2.1) implies that the total reads from all species in the sample equal \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.2} \\text{total reads}(a) = \\text{total density}(a) \\cdot \\text{mean efficiency}(a) \\cdot \\text{sequencing effort}(a), \\end{align}\\] where \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.3} \\text{mean efficiency}(a) \\equiv \\frac{\\sum_{j}\\text{density}_j(a)\\cdot \\text{efficiency}_j}{\\text{total density}(a)} \\end{align}\\] is the average or mean efficiency of cells in the sample. 2.2 Relative abundances (proportions and ratios) The term relative abundance carries multiple meanings in microbiome science. Microbiome researchers often use the relative abundance of a species in a sample to refer to its proportion, or number of cells from that species divided by the total number of cells from the taxonomic domain of interest (e.g. Prokaryotes). A second view, drawn from the statistical framework of Compositional Data Analysis, equates the relative abundances of species within a sample with the ratios of cell densities among two or more species (e.g. a ratio of 5:4:2 among three species). By this view, it is meaningless to refer to the relative abundance of an individual species. Although other interpretations exist6, we focus on the proportion and ratio views as they underly most relative and absolute DA methods and the differences between them clarify when and why the effects of bias cancel in a DA analysis. The standard measurement of the proportion of species \\(i\\) in sample \\(a\\) is given by the ratio of its read count to the total, \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.4} \\widehat{\\text{prop}}_{i}(a) = \\frac{\\text{reads}_i(a)}{\\text{total reads(a)}}. \\end{align}\\] From Equations (2.1), (2.2), and (2.4), it follows that \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.5} \\widehat{\\text{prop}}_{i}(a) &amp;= \\text{prop}_{i}(a) \\cdot \\frac{\\text{efficiency}_{i}}{\\text{mean efficiency}(a)}, \\end{align}\\] where \\(\\text{prop}_{i}(a) = \\text{density}_{i}(a) / \\text{total density}(a)\\) is the actual proportion. Equation (2.5) says that taxonomic bias creates a multiplicative error equal to the ratio of the species’ efficiency to the mean efficiency in the sample. Consequently, the same species can be over- or under-measured depending on the composition of the given sample (Figure 2.1). For instance, in samples from two hypothetical communities in Figure 2.1, Species 3 has an efficiency of 6 and is under-measured in Sample 1 (which has a mean efficiency of 8.33) but over-measured in Sample 2 (which has a mean efficiency of 3.15). The measured ratio between species \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) is given by the ratio of their read counts, \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.6} \\widehat{\\text{ratio}}_{i/j}(a) = \\frac{\\text{reads}_i(a)}{\\text{reads}_j(a)}. \\end{align}\\] From Equations (2.1) and (2.6), it follows that \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.7} \\widehat{\\text{ratio}}_{i/j}(a) % \\frac{\\text{reads}_{i}(a)}{\\text{reads}_{j}(a)} &amp;= \\frac{\\text{density}_{i}(a)}{\\text{density}_{j}(a)} \\cdot \\frac{\\text{efficiency}_{i}}{\\text{efficiency}_{j}}. \\end{align}\\] The fold error in the ratio between two species simply equals the ratio in their efficiencies and is therefore constant across samples. For instance, in the example of Figure 2.1, the ratio of Species 3 (with an efficiency of 6) to Species 1 (with an efficiency of 1) is over-estimated by a factor of 6 in both communities despite their varying compositions. Figure 2.1: Taxonomic bias creates sample-dependent multiplicative errors in species proportions, which can lead to inaccurate fold changes between samples. Top row: Error in proportions measured by MGS in two microbiome samples that contain different relative abundances of three species. Bottom row: Error in the measured fold-change in the third species that is derived from these measurements. 2.3 Absolute abundances (cell densities) A range of experimental and computational methods can be used to convert the relative-abundance information in the read counts into measurements of (absolute) cell densities; however, these methods can largely be partitioned into those that use the measured proportions or the measured ratios provided by MGS. The error in density measurements due to taxonomic bias therefore follows that of the proportion and ratio measurements described above. Proportion-based density measurement is based on the idea that if we know the (true) proportion of a species and the (true) total density of all species, we can multiply these numbers obtain the species’ density. This method therefore involves multiplying the proportion of a species measured from MGS with a measurement of total microbial density obtain through other means (e.g., through direct cell counting or qPCR of a universal marker gene) to measure its density, \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.8} \\widehat{\\text{density}}_{i}(a) = \\widehat{\\text{prop}}_{i}(a) \\cdot \\widehat{\\text{total density}}(a). \\end{align}\\] Substituting the expression (2.5) for the measured proportion and allowing for error in the total density measurement, leads to the expression \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.9} \\widehat{\\text{density}}_{i}(a) = \\text{density}_{i}(a) \\cdot \\frac{\\text{efficiency}_{i}}{\\text{mean efficiency}(a)} \\cdot \\begin{array}{c} \\text{fold error in} \\\\ \\widehat{\\text{total density}}(a) \\end{array}. \\end{align}\\] The multiplicative error consists of two factors: the error in the estimated proportion (due to taxonomic bias in the MGS measurement), and any error in the estimated total density. In the case of perfect knowledge of the total density, the fold error in proportion-based density estimates varies across samples inversely with the mean efficiency. Ratio-based density estimation follows from the fact that, in the absence of taxonomic bias, the conversion rate from reads to density is just the sequencing effort of the sample and is thus the same for all species (Equation (2.1)). Knowing the density of at least one reference species therefore enables us to convert from reads to density for all species. One approach to obtaining such reference species is to add one or more extraneous species in known (typically constant) abundance (a “spike-in”) to each sample prior to sequencing (REFs). A second approach is to determine a set of naturally occurring species that are thought to have a constant, though typically unknown, abundance across samples; in this case we can only estimate species’ densities relative to these “housekeeping species” (REFs). A third (seemingly untried) possibility is to measure the density of one or more naturally occurring species using a method such as targeted CFU counting, fluorescence flow cytometry or ddPCR directly on cells, or ddPCR or qPCR on extracted DNA. Given the estimate of the density of reference taxon \\(r\\), we estimate the density of taxon \\(i\\) by multipling the ratio of \\(i\\) to \\(r\\) in the reads by the density of \\(r\\), \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.10} \\widehat{\\text{density}}_{i}(a) = \\frac{\\text{reads}_{i}(a)}{\\text{reads}_{r}(a)} \\cdot \\widehat{\\text{density}}_{r}(a) \\end{align}\\] (Appendix ??? describes how this equation can be extended to multiple reference species.) For a constant reference species with unknown density, we can set \\(\\widehat{\\text{density}}_{r}(a)\\) equal to 1 to estimate density in units of the density of the reference species. The error in this ratio-based density estimate is \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{2.11} \\widehat{\\text{density}}_{i}(a) = \\text{density}_{i}(a) \\cdot \\frac{\\text{efficiency}_{i}}{\\text{efficiency}_{r}} \\cdot \\begin{array}{c} \\text{fold error in} \\\\ \\widehat{\\text{density}_r}(a) \\end{array}. \\end{align}\\] Again, the multiplicative error consists of two factors: the error in the estimated ratio (due to taxonomic bias in the MGS measurement), and error in the estimated density of the reference taxa. So long as the fold error in the reference density is constant across samples, so will be the error in the estimated density of the focal species \\(i\\). Note: The current distinction between proportion- and ratio-based density estimation is incomplete, as the example of spike-in normalization shows: Whether the density of species \\(i\\) is estimated by Equation (2.10), or by first estimating total density from the ratio of non-spike-in to spike-in reads and then using Equation (2.8), the results are mathematically identical. Future revisions should clarify this point.

Though there are many ways to quantitatively define such change, here we restrict our attention to inferring the multiplicative or (equivalently) log fold change in proportions, ratios, and cell densities, which have direct ecological interpretations (via the processes of exponential growth and death) and are ubiquitous in microbiome DA analysis. 3.1 Change between a pair of samples Before considering the stereotypical many-sample DA analysis, it is instructive to consider simplest analysis of differential abundance: the measurement of fold changes in abundance between a pair of samples. This case is relevant for understanding common visualizations for comparing abundances across individual samples, such as the ubiquitous proportion bar plot and abundances-through-time trajectories within a single host or environment, and conceptually bridges the single-sample results of the previous section to the many-sample case. The composition-dependent effect of bias on fold error in proportions leads to error in fold-change measurements that is proportional to the inverse change in mean efficiency. From the error in an individual sample (Equation (2.5)), it follows that the measured fold change in proportion of taxon \\(i\\) from sample \\(a\\) to sample \\(b\\) is \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{3.1} % \\tag*{Fold change in proportion} \\underbrace{\\frac{\\widehat{\\text{prop}}_{i}(b)}{\\widehat{\\text{prop}}_{i}(a)}} _\\text{measured FC} &amp;= \\frac {\\text{prop}_{i}(b) \\cdot \\cancel{\\text{efficiency}_{i}} / {\\text{mean efficiency}(b)}} {\\text{prop}_{i}(a) \\cdot \\cancel{\\text{efficiency}_{i}} / {\\text{mean efficiency}(a)}} \\\\[0.5ex] &amp;= \\underbrace{\\frac{\\text{prop}_{i}(b)}{\\text{prop}_{i}(a)}}_\\text{actual FC} \\cdot \\underbrace{\\left[\\frac{\\text{mean efficiency}(b)}{\\text{mean efficiency}(a)}\\right]^{-1}}_\\text{fold error} . \\end{align}\\] The sample-independent efficiency factor of the error cancels, but the sample-dependent mean efficiency does not, leaving an error equal to the inverse of the change in the mean efficiency from \\(s\\) to \\(t\\). The bottom row of Figure 2.1 illustrates how variation in mean efficiency leads to error in the inferred fold changes between a pair of samples. The mean efficiency decreases by a factor of 2.6 (FC: 0.4X) from Sample 1 to Sample 2. Consequently, the FC of each species is measured to be 2.6X larger than the true value. Though the fold error for all species is the same, the implications depend on the actual FC and correspond to three distinct types of error: an increase in magnitude, a decrease in magnitude, and a change in direction (or sign). We can see each type of error in Figure 2.1. For Species 1, which increases and thus moves in the opposite direction of the mean efficiency, we see an increase in magnitude of the measured FC (actual FC: 2.3X, measured FC: 6.5X). For Species 2, which decreases and thus moves in the same direction as the mean efficiency but by a larger factor, we see an decrease in magnitude (actual FC: 0.15X, measured FC: 0.44X). For Species 2, which decreases by a smaller factor than the mean efficiency, we see a change in direction (actual FC: 0.6X, measured FC: 1.8X), such that the species actually appears to increase! In contrast, because species ratios are distorted by a constant factor, their measured fold changes remain accurate. The fold error in Equation (2.7) completely cancels when we divide the ratio measured for one sample \\(a\\) by another sample \\(b\\). If other error sources remain negligible (or constant across samples), than this dichotomy continues to apply to proportion- and ratio-based density measurements. The inferred FCs in proportion-based density measurements will be incorrect by a factor equal to the inverse fold change in the mean efficiency, creating magnitude and/or directional errors. Moreover, any species with a constant density will appear to vary inversely with the mean efficiency. In contrast, fold changes in ratio-based density measurements will remain accurate. 3.2 Regression analysis of many samples DA analysis of many samples across host or environmental conditions can typically be framed as a regression problem, in which we analyze the relationship between a microbial response variable, such as log density of some focal species \\(i\\), and one or more covariates, such the pH or temperature of the sampled environment or whether the sample is from a healthy or sick person. A large fraction of DA analyses use elaborations on the simple linear regression model, which for a response of log species density can be written \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{3.2} \\log \\text{density}_i(a) = \\alpha + \\beta x(a) + \\varepsilon_i(a). \\end{align}\\] Here \\(x\\) is a continuous covariate (e.g. pH) or a binary covariate (e.g. \\(x=1\\) for treated patients and \\(x=0\\) for controls), \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are regression coefficients, and \\(\\varepsilon_i(a)\\) is a mean-zero random variable that reflects the residual (unexplained) variation in the response (log density of species \\(i\\)). Our interest is usually in the coefficient \\(\\beta\\) (slope or average difference between conditions) that describes how the species’ abundance changes with \\(x\\), while the intercept \\(\\alpha\\) captures differences in the baseline abundance and—we hope—measurement efficiency among species. How does taxonomic bias under our measurement model affect estimates of \\(\\beta\\) in the simple linear regression? Consider the case where the response is log density that has been estimated using proportion-based density estimation (Equation (2.8)) with error-free estimates of the total density. If the true log density follows the regression Equation (3.2), then it follows from Equation (2.9) the estimated log density equals \\[\\begin{align} \\tag{3.3} \\log \\widehat{\\text{density}}_i(a) % &amp;= \\alpha + \\beta x(a) + \\varepsilon_i(a) + \\log \\text{efficiency}_i - \\log \\text{mean efficiency}(a) = [\\alpha + \\log \\text{efficiency}_i] + [\\beta - \\log \\text{mean efficiency}(a)] x(a) + \\varepsilon_i(a). \\end{align}\\] This equation shows that the species-specific portion of the error affects the intercept term while the sample-specific portion (log mean efficiency) affects the slope term. Thus, as in the case of fold changes between two samples (Equation (3.1)), it is the variation in the (log) mean efficiency across samples that we must worry about distorting our DA results. The variation in measurement error created by the log mean efficiency impacts the point estimate and precision of the regression coefficient \\(\\beta\\). Box 3.3 mathematically describes this effect for estimation via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), which Figure 3.1 illustrates using simulated data. Variation in the log mean efficiency that is associated with the covariate \\(x\\) creates a systematic error in the estimated slope \\(\\hat \\beta\\) equal to the negative of the (scaled) covariance of log mean efficiency with \\(x\\). The absolute error is the same for all species; however, its relative value depends on the magnitude of the covariance of the log mean efficiency with \\(x\\) relative to that of the response (here, \\(\\log \\text{density}_{i}\\)) with \\(x\\) or, equivalently, the relative magnitudes of their slopes. As in the case of fold changes between pairs of samples, the net effect can be decreases in magnitude (Species 9, 10, and 1 in Figure 3.1), changes in sign (Species 5), or increases in magnitude (remaining species) depending on these relative values. Variation in the log mean efficiency that is uncorrelated with \\(x\\) does not systematically distort \\(\\hat \\beta\\) but does affect its precision, typically leading to increased standard errors as the variation in log mean efficiency effectively acts as an additional source of noise in measured abundance (Figure 3.1 D). The exception is for species whose residual variation is strongly positively correlated with that of log mean efficiency (here, Species 9), which can appear to have less random variation and receive standard errors that are too small. Decreased magnitudes and increased standard errors can both cause associations to be missed that would otherwise have been detected (Species 10 and 1), while increased magnitudes can turn weak or statistically insignificant associations into strong and statistically significant ones (Species 7, 6 and 4). With this understanding in place, we briefly summarize how taxonomic bias affects estimation of the simple linear model in other abundance types. The results for proportion-based density estimates with accurate total densities also apply to LFC analysis of proportions. Similar results apply to microbiome regression tools (such as corncob; Martin, Witten, and Willis (2020)) that perform regression on the logit (instead of log) proportion of a species; however, the mean efficiency of the entire sample must instead be replaced with the mean efficiency among all species excluding the focal species, which causes the absolute error in regression coefficients to vary somewhat across species. Because ratios and ratio-based densities are subject to consistent multiplicative error, in analysis of log ratios and the log densities derived from them, only the estimated intercept \\(\\hat \\alpha\\) is affected by taxonomic bias, while the point estimate and standard error of the estimated slope \\(\\hat \\beta\\) remain unaffected. Figure 3.1: Taxonomic bias distorts multi-sample differential abundance inference when the mean efficiency of samples is associated with the covariate of interest. This figure shows the results of a regression analysis of simulated microbiomes consisting of 50 samples and 10 species from two environmental conditions indexed by \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=1\\). In this simulation, the species with the largest efficiency (Species 9) also has the largest positive LFC, which drives the positive association of the log mean efficiency with the condition (shown in Panels A and B). This positive LFC in the log mean efficiency induces a systematic negative shift in the estimated LFCs of all species (Panels C and D). Panel D shows the mean LFC (points) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), for each species estimated from either the actual or the measured densities. The error (difference in LFC estimates on measured and actual) equals the negative LFC of the mean efficiency (shown in Panel B). 3.3 Box: Error in estimated regression coefficients and standard errors Results from statistics on regression under measurement error can help us understand the effect of bias on DA regression analysis. Consider Equation (3.2) for the simple linear regression of log density of a species \\(i\\) on covariate \\(x\\). Let \\(y\\) stand for the actual log density of a focal species \\(i\\), \\(z\\) stand for the log density that we’ve measured, and \\(d = z - y\\) equal the difference between the two, which here is the log efficiency of species \\(i\\) minus the log mean efficiency of the sample. Let \\(s_{xy}\\) denote the sample covariance between variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\), \\(s^{2}_{x} = s_{xx}\\) and \\(s_{x}\\) denote the sample variance and standard deviation, and \\(r_{xy} = s_{xy}/(s_{x}s_{y})\\) denote the sample correlation. The ordinary least squares (OLS) and maximum likelihood (MLE) estimates of the slope of \\(z\\) equals the sample covariance of \\(z\\) and \\(x\\) divided by the sample variance in \\(x\\) or, equivalently, the sample correlation of \\(z\\) and \\(x\\) multiplied by the ratio of their sample standard deviations, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat \\beta_z = \\frac{s_{zx}}{s^2_x} = r_{zx} \\cdot \\frac{s_y}{s_x}. \\end{align}\\] From the (bi)linearity of sample covariances it follows that \\[\\begin{align} \\hat \\beta_z = \\frac{s_{yx}}{s^2_x} + \\frac{s_{dx}}{s^2_x} = \\frac{r_{yx} s_y}{s_x} + \\frac{r_{dx} s_d}{s_x} = \\hat \\beta_y + \\hat \\beta_d, \\end{align}\\] where \\(\\hat \\beta_y\\) and \\(\\hat \\beta_d\\) denote the slope estimates for \\(y\\) and \\(d\\) (were these values to be known). The absolute error in the estimate \\(\\hat \\beta_{z}\\) of \\(\\hat \\beta_{y}\\) is therefore \\(\\hat \\beta_{d}\\); it is large in a practical sense when \\(\\hat \\beta_{d}\\) is large (in absolute value) compared to \\(\\hat \\beta_{y}\\), which corresponds to the covariance of \\(d\\) with \\(x\\) being large compared to the covariance of \\(y\\) with \\(x\\). In our case, the covariance of \\(d\\) equals the negative of the covariance of log mean efficiency with \\(x\\). The absolute error (i.e., the bias in a statistical sense) in \\(\\hat \\beta\\) is equals the negative covariance of log mean efficiency scaled by the variance in \\(x\\). This absolute error is the same for all species; however, its practical significance varies depending on its magnitude relative to that of the slope of the actual log densities. For species that covary with \\(x\\) more strongly than the log mean efficiency, the error will be relatively small. This situation might occur either because the mean efficiency varies relatively little across samples or because its variation is relatively less correlated with \\(x\\) compared to the log density of the focal species. We can similarly understand the impact of measurement error on the precision of our slope estimates. The OLS and MLE estimated standard error in \\(\\hat \\beta\\) are both approximately \\[\\begin{align} \\hat{\\text{se}}(\\hat \\beta) \\approx \\frac{s_{\\hat \\varepsilon}}{s_x \\sqrt{n}}, \\end{align}\\] where \\(s_{\\hat \\varepsilon}\\) is the sample standard deviation of the residuals (Wasserman (2004) Chapter 13). The sample residuals of \\(z\\), \\(y\\), and \\(d\\) have a similar relationship to the regression coefficient estimates, \\[\\begin{align} \\hat \\varepsilon_z &amp;\\equiv z - \\hat \\beta_z x \\\\&amp;= (y + d) - (\\hat \\beta_y + \\hat \\beta_d) x \\\\&amp;= (y - \\hat \\beta_y x) + (d - \\hat \\beta_d x) \\\\&amp;= \\hat \\varepsilon_y + \\hat \\varepsilon_d. \\end{align}\\] (Note, here I’ve omitted the subscript indicating the dependence on the sample.) It follows that the sample variances of the residuals of \\(z\\), \\(y\\), and \\(d\\) are related through \\[\\begin{align} s^2_{\\hat \\varepsilon_{z}} = s^2_{\\hat \\varepsilon_{y} + \\hat \\varepsilon_{d}} = s^2_{\\hat \\varepsilon_{y}} + s^2_{\\hat \\varepsilon_{d}} + 2 s_{\\hat \\varepsilon_{y} \\hat \\varepsilon_{d}}. \\end{align}\\] The standard deviation of the \\(z\\) residuals is increased above that of the \\(y\\) residuals when the \\(d\\) residuals are either uncorrelated or positively correlated with the \\(y\\) residuals, but may be decreased when the \\(y\\) and \\(d\\) residuals are negatively correlated. In our case, the \\(d\\) residuals equal the negative residuals of the log mean efficiency. It is plausible that for most species, their residual variation will have a small covariance with log mean efficiency and the net effect of variation in the mean efficiency will be to increase the estimated standard errors, as occurs with most species in Figure 3.1. However, high-efficiency species that vary substantially in proportion across samples may be strongly positively correlated with log mean efficiency such that the estimated standard errors decrease, as we see with Species 9 in Figure 3.1. References "],["implications.html", "4 Implications for real-world inference  4.1 Systematic error in slope or LFC estimates 4.2 Loss of power and precision (stub)", " 4 Implications for real-world inference  Are biologically significant errors in DA analyses likely in practice? We can begin to answer this question using a combination of theoretical analysis, consideration of hypothetical scenarios, and analysis of case studies for which some information about taxonomic bias is available. 4.1 Systematic error in slope or LFC estimates Recall from Section 3 that the error in the slope or LFC in a DA regression analysis is proportional to the covariance of the log mean efficiency with the covariate. This covariance can be split into two components: the standard deviation of (log) mean efficiency and its correlation with the covariate. Hence when considering whether taxonomic bias creates large error, it can be useful to separately ask whether the mean efficiency is likely to vary across samples and whether it is likely to be correlated with a covariate of interest. One approach to studying the mean efficiency empirically is to analyze data from studies for which control measurements allow direct measurement of species’ efficiencies. Brooks et al. (2015) performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of mock communities of seven bacterial species thought to play a critical role in the human vaginal microbiome with the MGS protocol developed for the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project (VaHMP). McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019) later used this data to estimate the efficiencies of these seven species and develop a method to use these estimates to infer the true compositions of natural samples (see Section @ref(#calibrate-compositions)). SI Analysis (MOMS-PI) uses these estimated efficiencies to correct the compositions and explore the implied variation in mean efficiency in the VaHMP’s Multi-Omic Microbiome Study: Pregnancy Initiative (MOMS-PI) Fettweis et al. (2019). The vaginal microbiome during pregnancy is characterized by relatively low diversity, with a single Lactobacillus species often forming a majority of reads (considered to be the healthy state) but with occasional shifts to high proportions of other species, such as Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Streptococcus agalactiae, which are thought to cause or indicate poor vaginal health and increased risk of preterm birth. The analysis of McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019) showed that the efficiencies of two common Lactobacillus species, L. crispatus and L. iners, were 20-30X greater than that of G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, and S. agalactiae. Analysis of microbiome trajectories of a single patient across visits indicates that the mean efficiency typically decreases by a factor of 3-10X when the community shifts from a high to low-Lactobacillus state. (NOTE: This is a super preliminary claim based on looking at just one woman, and is just a placeholder) Decreases in mean efficiency during transitions from Lactobacillus to Gardnerella dominance can be expected to be even more extreme for commonly-used vaginal microbiome primers that fail to amplify Gardnerella. A second study in which control communities make it possible to directly analyze the impact of taxonomic bias in experimental samples was performed by Leopold and Busby (2020). To study the interactions between a host plant and its fungal commensals and pathogen, the authors inoculated trees with a fungal synthetic community and later exposed plants to a fungal pathogen. The authors used ITS amplicon sequencing to measure communities before and after infection, along with mock communities which they used to estimate the species efficiencies with the method of McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019). (DNA mocks were used, so that bias due to DNA extraction is not included, but other major bias sources such as PCR and ribosomal copy-number-variation are included.) The pathogen was 10X more efficiently measured than the median commensal and 40X more efficiently measured than the lowest-efficiency commensal. A re-analysis of their data (SI Analysis) shows that the mean efficiency varies by ??? in pre-infection communities and by an average of ??? pre- and post-infection, with the latter driven by the dramatic increase in the high-efficiency pathogen. These case studies indicate that one mechanism for variability in the mean efficiency is swings between very high (\\(\\sim 1\\)) and low (\\(\\ll 1\\)) proportions of species with particularly high or low efficiencies. In highly diverse ecosystems, as seen in soil and the human gut (CHECK), one species rarely dominates within a given sample and so such large swings are not possible. We might therefore think that the mean efficiency will remain fairly stable in these settings. In fact, one can show mathematically that in randomly assembled communities, the mean efficiency becomes more stable as (Inverse Simpson) diversity increases, as the mean effectively averages over a greater number of species. Real communities do not assemble randomly, however. Variance in the mean efficiency may remain high if environmental filtering leads to different groups of organisms dominating in different environments, particularly if shared phenotypic values or evolutionary history causes these groups to differ in their efficiencies as well as their ecology. For example, gut microbiomes typically have high diversity at the species level but are dominated by just a small number of phyla, and two in particular: The Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes, the ratio of which varies substantially across individuals (CHECK). Many DNA extraction protocols have been found to more efficiently lyse Gram-negative Bacteroidetes species than Gram-positive Firmicutes species (though variation can also be substantial within phyla, McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019)). Gut samples with large differences in their Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes proportions may therefore have large variation in mean efficiency even if the individual species within each phylum never reach a large proportion. On the other hand, competitive-exclusion dynamics can favor more stable taxonomic and/or phenotypic compositions across samples and might thereby drive a more stable mean efficiency than under random assembly Systematic error in DA results requires that the variation in log mean efficiency is correlated with the covariate. The examples above each suggest plausible biologically-significant scenarios in which such correlations might arise. For example, in the vaginal microbiome a decline in Lactobacillus and rise of species including Gardnerella vaginalis is associated with preterm birth in pregnant women; hence the variation in mean efficiency driven by these species may also create an association of mean efficiency with preterm status. In the plant-fungal experiment of Leopold and Busby (2020), the increase in pathogen proportion after infection leads to a large increase in the mean efficiency over time, which systematic increases the observed decline in the proportions of commensal species (SI Analysis). The ratio of Bacteroidetes to Firmicutes has been linked to several host traits and health conditions, and thus the variation in efficiency between these two phyla may also drive an association of mean efficiency with these traits. Are there general mechanisms by which we might expect associations to arise between mean efficiency and the covariates commonly of interest in microbiome studies? One possibility is that the ecology and measurement efficiency of species may become correlated simply due to shared evolutionary history. A species’ efficiency is heavily influenced by genetically determined traits such as cell-wall structure, ribosomal-operon copy number, sequence in a primer-targeted region, GC content, and even whether the species is present in a given taxonomic database. Shared evolutionary history creates positive trait associations among more closely related species, such that we should expect a significant degree of phylogenetic conservation in efficiency. Meanwhile, the same shared evolutionary history creates phylogenetic conservation in ecological traits that drives species abundance dynamics. In this way, we may expect evolution to lead to a situation in which groups of species with similar efficiencies have similar shifts in abundance between conditions, creating the potential for commensurate shifts in mean efficiency. For example, a change in diet that favors Bacteroidetes species relative to Firmicutes based on the resulting gut conditions will also increase the relative abundance of easy-to-lyse species. Associations between efficiency and abundance can also arise more directly when a single microbial trait affects both. For example, microbes at the ocean floor are slowly buried, sinking into a low nutrient, low oxygen environment. Lloyd et al. (2020) estimate the log fold change in the estimated absolute abundance of various taxa with sediment depth (as a proxy for time) to determine which taxa are able to persist and even grow in this difficult environment. It is plausible that microbes with tougher cell walls would tend to persist longer (alive or dead) in the sediment, while at the same time being more difficult to extract DNA from than microbes with weaker cell walls. As the relative abundance of tougher species increases with depth, the mean extraction efficiency might therefore decrease. This decrease would increase the inferred log fold changes and could lead to inferred growth of taxa that are actually just persisting or even slowly dying off. Another example of a trait that might simultaneously affect efficiency and relative abundance is ribosomal copy number, which increases the measurement efficiency in ribosomal amplicon experiments and is also linked to differences in ecology and population dynamics among species. The biological significance of the error in \\(\\hat \\beta\\) depends on the relative magnitude of the LFC (or covariance with the covariate \\(x\\)) in the focal species vs in the mean efficiency. It may generally be true that the largest species LFCs in a DA analysis, which are often of primary interest in a microbiome study, will tend to be larger than the LFC of the mean efficiency, at least in high-diversity settings. (This seems intuitively likely and true in examples, but I haven’t analyzed it much mathematically and don’t have a firm handle on this question.) Further investigation into this question may improve our confidence in the top hits identified in published DA analyses meeting certain conditions. However, we must remain weary of cases (as in the vaginal-microbiome and plant-fungal-interactions examples above) in which a shift in a single species can drive large changes in mean efficiency and lead to significant errors for other species. The experimental and computational methods discussed in Section 5 can mitigate taxonomic bias in these clearly-problematic cases while also helping to amass empirical evidence on the conditions in which bias is unlikely to cause major inferential errors. Todo: Address DA analysis of aggregate (or synthetic) taxa, such as phyla, which may be prone to errors due to changes in the species-level make-up of the taxon. Error in total-density measurements: So far we have ignored error in total-density measurements that are used to convert estimated proportions to estimated densities; however, in reality these measurements are likely to contain substantial systematic error that can either worsen or improve the error in LFC estimates. Todo: Add to previous section or Appendix with the relevant theory. To understand how, we can consider the question of whether bulk 16S qPCR or flow cytometry is a more appropriate method of measuring total bacterial density for use in proportion-based density measurement (Galazzo et al. (2020), Jian, Salonen, and Korpela (2021)). 16S rRNA-gene qPCR measures the concentration of 16S rRNA gene copies in the extracted DNA and is therefore affected by variation among species in DNA extraction efficiency, 16S copy number, and primer-binding and amplification efficiency. For example, McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019) found that the product of extraction efficiency and 16S copy number for Lactobacillus iners was 20X larger than Gardnerella vaginalis (CHECK NUMBERS), such that we should expect samples dominated by L. iners to result in qPCR estimates 10-20X higher than equally dense samples dominated by G. vaginalis. These observations suggest that 16S qPCR is a poor proxy for fold changes in total bacterial density. Yet, as recently suggested by Jian, Salonen, and Korpela (2021), this taxonomic bias in qPCR may simultaneously make it a good measure of total density for use with 16S amplicon sequencing for proportion-based density estimation. 16S amplicon sequencing shares these same sources of bias and so is likely to have species efficiencies highly similar to those for the qPCR measurements, which we can predict to cause the mean 16S-qPCR efficiency to closely follow the mean 16S-sequencing efficiency, such that the error induced by one largely cancels the error induced by the other (Ref Appendix). In contrast, species-specific efficiencies in bulk cell counting are less likely to be strongly correlated with those from 16S sequencing. Even supposing cell counting were to provide perfectly accurate measures of total density, it may actually perform worse than qPCR for DA analysis of proportion-based density estimation precisely because the error does not mirror that in the 16S measurement. On the other hand, bulk or targeted measurement (or DNA spike-ins) that occurs post DNA-extraction is subject to other error that is not likely to counter that of the 16S-based proportion estimates. The yield of DNA extraction can show highly random variation and also be highly non-linear (as a function of cellular biomass) at high concentrations. This features create error that is unlikely to offset the variation in mean efficiency in the 16S sequencing (todo: clarify why). Targeted measurement of cells and cellular spike-ins, discussed in Section 5, can avoid this issue while also facilitating ratio-based analysis while (unlike bulk cell counting) remaining robust mean-efficiency variation. 4.2 Loss of power and precision (stub) Variation in mean efficiency that is not associated with covariates can still majorly hinder the goals of microbiome studies by causing reductions in the precision of LFC estimates and the power to detect true associations of a given size. Illustrate with case studies? Mention counting noise as an important factor that we’ve so far ignored but that can interact with taxonomic bias to lead to very low precision in LFC estimates. Low efficiency can put a species below the detection limit set by sample read depth, making it impossible to get precise LFCs. Study-specific efficiencies can explain why associations often do not replicate across studies. Example: Gardnerella vaginalis associations are not detected in certain vaginal microbiome studies that used V13 primers which we now know are bad at amplifying it. Conclude with a nod to the value of the solutions in Section 5 to address these issues: Correcting the errors caused by mean-efficiency variation can improve precision, and bias-sensitivity analysis and bias-aware meta-analysis can give a better sense of the increased uncertainty in LFC estimates due to unknown efficiencies, thereby helping us to understand the increased rate of false positives and/or the larger range of LFC estimates that are compatible with the observed data than what is implied by a bias-free model.

We present five that seem particularly promising: The first three are methods to correct or otherwise account for the effects of taxonomic bias to obtain more accurate DA results, whereas the second two treat the measurement efficiencies as unknown parameters and seek to understand the additional uncertainty they create, either in the results of individual studies or in joint analysis of multiple studies that used different MGS protocols. Figure 5.1: Fold changes can be calibrated using community controls or reference species. The figure compares the performance of three methods for measuring fold changes in absolute cell density in cellular mock communities of 7 vaginal species, which were constructed and measured via 16S sequencing by Brooks et al. (2015). The ‘Uncalibrated’ fold changes are derived directly from uncalibrated individual abundance measurements, which equal the product of the species’ proportion by the total density (which here is be known to be constant by construction). The ‘Calibrated (community)’ measurements are computed from abundance measurements where the proportions are first corrected for the taxonomic bias that was estimated from a single sample that contained all 7 species. The ‘Calibrated (reference)’ measurements are computed from abundances measured with the reference-species method, with Lactobacillus crispatus used as the reference; that is, the true abundance of L. crispatus is treated as known and used to infer the abundance of the remaining 6 species. Only samples that contain L. crispatus are included. 5.1 Calibrate compositions using community controls The most complete but experimentally challenging approach to mitigating taxonomic bias involves directly measuring the efficiencies of individual species using control samples (McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019)). Suitable controls are any community sample whose composition (species identities and relative abundances) has been previously characterized, either by construction (in the case of constructed ‘mock’ communities) or by measurement with a reference protocol chosen to serve as a measurement standard. These controls, when measured alongside the target experimental samples, can be used to estimate the relative efficiencies among the superset of species across the control samples. The estimated efficiencies can then be used to calibrate the measured relative abundances among the control species in the target samples to the chosen measurement standard, by simply dividing the species’ read counts by their corresponding efficiencies (McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019)) or using a more sophisticated statistical modeling framework. These calibrated compositions can then be used for arbitrary downstream microbiome analyses, including DA analysis. Calibration of species not in the controls requires first imputing their efficiencies from the control measurements, for example using phylogenetic relationships, genetic characteristics (such as 16S copy number), and/or phenotypic properties (such as cell-wall structure). Though such imputation is conceptually straightforward, its accuracy and ultimate utility remain untested. The above states the approach; can add description/discussion of application to the MOMS-PI and Leopold and Busby (2020) cases and developments and challenges in availability of control communities ‘more sophisticated modeling framework’ - cite Williamson, Hughes, and Willis (2021) and https://microbiomemeasurement.org/posts/bias-estimation-from-mocks-with-fido/ 5.2 Use ratio-based abundance measurement The DA analyses we consider don’t need accurate estimates of relative abundances within individual samples—they only require accurate fold changes across samples. Section 3 showed that fold changes in species ratios and ratio-based density estimates can remain accurate even when taxonomic bias distorts the values in individual samples. Hence a solution is to use to analyze variation in ratios and ratio-based density estimates. For the latter, practical options include spike-ins of extraneous species at constant and/or known density housekeeping taxa, stipulated or computationally identified as having a constant density across samples targeted measurement of specific taxa TBD what further discussion or illustration to have here. 5.3 Calibrate fold changes using measurements of targeted taxa In some cases, we may still which to use a proportion-based approach to analyzing variation in density. For example, in some systems measuring total cell concentration may be easier than implementing a spike-in experiment or determining a set of reference species to directly measure for which at least one species is present in all samples. In this case, targeted measurements of one or more reference species can be used to validate and/or correct the fold changes or regression coefficients infered from the proportion-based densities. Recall that the error in proportion-based log fold changes (LFCs) is shared among species and is equal to the inverse LFC fold change in mean efficiency (Equations (3.1) and (3.3); Figure 3.1D). Consequently, an accurate LFC of one or more reference species can serve as a general validation or used to correct the LFCs of all species. Note: I may not correctly understand the next example, since I don’t yet see how this interpretation of Table 1 meshes with Figure 4 We illustrate this idea with an example from the study by Lloyd et al. (2020) described in Section 4, which estimated doubling times for various taxa from the measured log increase in cell density with burial time in marine sediments. The primary analysis, which used proportion-based density estimates, was supported by targeted measurements (qPCR) of 16S concentration for several bacterial and archeal taxa (CHECK). In Core 30, the doubling time estimated for the Archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota was estimated to be 10.1 years (CHECK) using the proportion-based densities and 10.3 years by qPCR (Lloyd et al. (2020) Table 1 and Figure 4). These doubling times correspond to highly similar estimated slopes of log density per year of \\(1/10.1 \\approx 0.99\\) and \\(1/10.3\\approx 0.97\\). The difference between these slopes, \\(\\approx 0.02\\), estimates the slope of the mean efficiency. It’s small value suggests little systematic variation in mean efficiency with burial time and hence little systematic bias in the estimated doubling times derived from the proportion-based density estimates. In this case, close agreement in the DA results across methods for a specific taxon suggests that variation in sample mean efficiency did not significantly distort the MGS-based results and hence provides a degree of validation for all taxa, not just the taxa with targeted measurements. (An important caveat for this example is that this analysis assumes consistent efficiencies at the higher taxonomic levels used for qPCR measurement and MGS analysis performed by Lloyd et al. (2020).) Here we compared summary statistics; however, in principle a joint statistical analysis of targeted and proportion-based density measurements would provide more statistical power to estimate and correct the effects of variation in the mean efficiency across samples and provide calibrated fold change and regression estimates for all taxa [APPENDIX]. 5.4 Perform a bias sensitivity analysis What can we do for experiments that have been conducted without control communities, targeted control measurements, or spike-ins? One approach is to conduct a bias sensitivity analysis to probe the extent and way in which the results of a DA analysis are sensitive to different possible taxonomic biases in our experiment. A straightforward approach to bias sensitivity analysis is to use computer simulation to randomly generate efficiency vectors, each of which is used to calibrate the MGS measurements. These calibrated MGS measurements represent the true compositions under the hypothesized taxonomic bias. By re-running our DA analysis and comparing results across these simulated datasets, we can begin to understand how our initial results might be influenced by the strength and structure of the taxonomic bias in our experiment. The simulated efficiency vectors may be generated to reflect certain hypotheses about bias in the given system. The utility of such simulations can increase the more we learn about the magnitude of bias in different systems and the taxonomic and protocol features that determine it. Future work in developing tools and methods for simulating efficiency vectors and performing bias sensitivity analyses could be a valuable way to assay and improve the reliability of microbiome results—for differential abundance and microbiome analyses more generally. 5.5 Use bias-aware meta-analysis So far we have considered analysis of samples subject to the same taxonomic bias; however, meta-analysis of microbiome samples measured across multiple studies must often contend with a diversity of protocols and hence taxonomic biases in different groups of samples. This inconsistency in taxonomic bias across studies poses a problem even for ratio-based analyses where the effects of bias might cancel within a study. A potential solution is to perform a bias-aware meta-analyses that jointly analyzes multiple data from studies while explicitely acknowledges the distinct, unknown taxonomic bias in each study. Parametric microbiome meta-analysis models already include sets of species-specific latent parameters to model “batch effects”—amorphous differences in the measurements of each study. By configuring these models so that these latent parameters correspond to the study and species specific efficiencies, we can increase the biological interpretability of these models and gain ability to determine whether disageements in DA results across studies are due to differences in taxonomic bias or other differences (such as host cohort or study design). Using a biophysically motivated model parameterization may also lead to performance gains in terms of increased explanatory power for a given model complexity, as seen for models of mock community measurements by McLaren, Willis, and Callahan (2019), which can increase improve our ability to find reproducible microbial associations in a given meta-study. 5.6 Supplemental figures Figure 5.2: Example of a bias sensivity analysis.
